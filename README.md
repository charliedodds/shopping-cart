# Shopping Cart Project

Started as part of The Odin Project

## Assignment

- Should have at least 2 pages (home and shop)
- Users should see a sticky bar displaying number of items in the cart with a button to proceed to checkout
- Items should have individual cards with ability to increase/decrease quantity and add to card (which should update accordingly)

## Tools

- [CheapShark API](https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/)

## Usage

- Click the shop tab to see a display of currently on sale items rated by shop.
- Click an item to go to its own page to see more detail and add to cart.
- Click the cart on the top right to go to the full list of items along with total price and ability to remove items.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
